        <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>
          
          Our goal is to ensure customer satisfaction with the prompts purchased
          from our marketplace. Refunds will be granted solely in cases where
          the prompt does not work as described. To be eligible for a refund,
          you must submit a request within 24 hours of your purchase, providing
          a clear explanation and evidence demonstrating that the prompt is not
          functioning as described. Upon reviewing your request, we will
          determine, at our sole discretion, whether your claim is valid and, if
          so, issue a refund. Refunds will be processed within 5-10 business
          days after receiving your request.
