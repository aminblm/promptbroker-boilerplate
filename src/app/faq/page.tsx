          testing stolen credits to see if they work. When our systems detect this, we will 
          automatically refund the payment so that PromptBroker doesn't get hit with chargeback 
          fees/fines from credit card companies. </p> 
          <br>
          <p>It is super annoying for us and you as a creator. However, it had nothing to do with 
          your prompt, or a dissatisfied customer - and only happens to around 0.1% of transactions.</p>
